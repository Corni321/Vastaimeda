It automatically asks qualifying questions like "What's your company size?" and "What's your biggest challenge?" while integrating directly with CRMs.

**Drift** targets enterprise B2B companies at approximately $2,500/month[3], making it unsuitable for most SMBs despite its powerful account-based marketing capabilities.

ManyChat's social media automation demonstrates particular effectiveness, with clients reporting significant lead generation improvements through Instagram and Facebook integration[7].

## 6. Appointment Scheduling Bots

### Calendar Integration Solutions

The platform provides chat history for reviewing and revising answers, along with AI Actions for triggering events like CRM data logging.

**Zendesk Answer Bot** serves businesses heavily invested in the Zendesk ecosystem[3], suggesting relevant help articles before queries become support tickets. However, it struggles with information outside the Zendesk environment.

### Content Management and Maintenance

Effective FAQ automation requires structured knowledge base management. Voiceflow recommends organizing content into categories with 5-10 alternative phrasings per common question[6]. The platform emphasizes starting with the top 20 FAQs and gradually expanding based on user interactions and analytics.

Regular knowledge base updates are crucial for maintaining chatbot accuracy. Platforms like Chatbase provide "Revise Answers" features for accuracy improvements, while analytics help identify gaps in knowledge coverage.

### Deployment Strategies and Best Practices

Successful multichannel deployment requires strategic platform prioritization. SMBs should begin with their primary customer communication channels before expanding to additional platforms. ManyChat recommends starting with Facebook Messenger or Instagram, then adding WhatsApp and SMS based on customer preferences.
