## 2. Key Findings

### Lead Scoring Automation: Intelligent Prospect Prioritization

AI-powered lead scoring has evolved from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated predictive models that analyze dozens of data points simultaneously.

The platform's Breeze AI integration provides predictive lead scoring that learns from historical conversion patterns. HubSpot's freemium model makes it accessible to SMBs, with paid plans starting at $20/month per seat[9].

**Monday.com CRM** offers exceptional value for SMBs already using project management tools. Their AI lead management system automates lead qualification by analyzing behavior patterns and provides real-time data enrichment that updates prospect information automatically[8].
